> A recommendation is to use `Visual Studio Code` with the Python extension pack, and also to install the latest functional version of the Python interpreter, but you can use other Development environments like `Conda` and `Spyder` that will make your life a lot easier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These exercises and examples were made with the current `Python` version `3.11` please take that in mind if you are going to copy any code and doesn't work for you.
